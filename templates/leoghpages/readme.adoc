= LeoPages

Allows to easily deploy a Blazor WASM application to GitHub Pages.

== Initial Setup

IMPORTANT: Make sure to use a `public` repository or be a GitHub Pro user, otherwise the Pages feature is not available and the action run will fail.

. Create the project using the template
. Create a git repository and add/commit the initial project
. Create a new repository on GitHub
. Configure the GitHub repository as remote
. Push the project to the GitHub repository
** The action defined in the workflows should execute automatically
. *Make sure to enable Pages in the GitHub repository settings by selecting the gh-pages branch (root) and _saving_*

== Further Changes

Once the initial setup works, you can make any changes or additions to the blazor application, commit and push again, and the deployed pages will be updated automatically.
